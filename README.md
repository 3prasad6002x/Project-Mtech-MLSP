# Project-Mtech-MLSP
This project combines human vital signs, sleep, and activity data for anomaly detection using LSTM Autoencoder and CNN+LSTM models. Gaussian noise enhances robustness, while feature engineering strengthens classification. A Random Forest classifier ensures accurate predictions, enabling early health risk detection and scalable wellness monitoring.
